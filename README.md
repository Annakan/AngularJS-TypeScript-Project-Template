AngularJS and Typescript Project Template
=========================================

Very simple project template for writing AngularJS applications using TypeScript in a *TypeScript*-y way. That is:
- Everything is typed checked thanks to [/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)
- Controllers, filters, directives and services are classes.

This is heavily inspired in [/JakubMrozek/generator-angular-typescript](https://github.com/JakubMrozek/generator-angular-typescript)
